## Parallel amplicon sequencing error correction (PASEC) 

Workflow description language ([WDL](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/)) workflow for scalable amplicon sequencing analyses. Intended to be executed using [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell)
within one of its supported [backends](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Backends/), but can also be used directly on [FireCloud](https://portal.firecloud.org/). See FireCloud workspace [here]().

See [here](https://software.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/) for more information on how to access and use FireCloud. See [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) for more information on Cromwell.
